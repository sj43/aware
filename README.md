# What is Aware? 
Aware is an inter-car communication system designed to promote driver awareness and reduce traffic accidents. Drivers will use the Android app to send and respond to requests to change lanes, pass slow cars, and so on. 

## Motivation
Did you know that traffic accidents are the leading cause of mortality in America? According to the US Department of Transportation, there are over 6 million automotive crashes each year. 60% of these 6 million could have been prevented had the driver been alerted a mere half second before the collision. Last summer, our teammate Colin drove 5 hours a day on what is known as "America's deadliest highway." He wished he was able to notify other cars when he wanted to pass them or merge into another lane.

## Why Aware?
The reason we chose to do this as an app rather than integrated in a car is because not everyone's car has the technology to communicate with other cars (also because we're broke college students and don't have Teslas to test on). If many cars can't send/receive messages, then that defeats the purpose of our idea. However, almost everyone has a phone, meaning that the majority of drivers on the road will immediately be able to download our app and start using it to communicate with each other. In the past, this was impossible due to latency, but now it is a viable idea because of the advent of 5G.

## How to run
Use Android studio to run the project
